tech:

* language: Ruby
* rest framework: Sinatra
* http requests: faraday
* database: mongodb
* server: caddy
* container: all wrapped up in docker (docker-compose)
* uses GÃ¡bor's <https://crandb.r-pkg.org> API to get names of CRAN packages
* A cron job scrapes pkg specific data and maintainer level data once a day

## examples

All pkgs from a maintainer that have any checks not passing

```
curl https://cranchecks.info/maintainers/csardi.gabor_at_gmail.com | jq '.data.table[] | select(.any) | .package'
```

Similar but across all packages

```
curl https://cranchecks.info/pkgs?limit=10 | jq '.data[] | select(.summary.any) | .package'
```

Packages that have error status checks

```
curl https://cranchecks.info/pkgs?limit=1000 | jq '.data[] | select(.summary.error > 0) | .package'
```

The was originally just rOpenSci packages, but is now all packages on CRAN.

Base URL: <https://cranchecks.info/>

[API Docs](docs/api_docs.md)

No authentication needed

Check out [cchecks][] for an R package interface to this API

tech:

* language: Ruby
* rest framework: Sinatra
* scraping http requests: faraday
* database: mongodb
* server: caddy
* container: all wrapped up in docker (docker-compose)
* uses G√°bor's <https://crandb.r-pkg.org> API to get names of CRAN packages
* A cron job scrapes pkg specific data __every hour__ and maintainer level data __every 3rd hour__

## JSON API examples

To replicate the examples below as is, you'll need curl (which you likely have), and jq (<https://stedolan.github.io/jq/>) which you may not have. You can also just copy/paste the URLs into your browser üòè

All pkgs from a maintainer that have any checks not passing

```sh
curl https://cranchecks.info/maintainers/csardi.gabor_at_gmail.com | jq '.data.table[] | select(.any) | .package'
```

Similar but across all packages

```sh
curl https://cranchecks.info/pkgs?limit=10 | jq '.data[] | select(.summary.any) | .package'
```

Packages that have error status checks

```sh
curl https://cranchecks.info/pkgs?limit=1000 | jq '.data[] | select(.summary.error > 0) | .package'
```

## Badges

> also check out badges from Metacran [Gabor Cs√°rdi](https://github.com/gaborcsardi) for CRAN versions, CRAN release dates, and CRAN downloads <https://r-pkg.org/services#badges>

markdown egs to use in your README

linking to cran checks page (likely want to use `cran.r-project.org` url since cran check will complain about a different mirror's base url)

[![cran checks](https://cranchecks.info/badges/summary/reshape)](https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_reshape.html) -> `[![cran checks](https://cranchecks.info/badges/summary/reshape)](https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_reshape.html)`

Or maybe link to JSON response for this API

### package status summaries

- `/badges/summary/:package` all okay?, no notes, warnings, or errors
    - if any notes, warnings, or errors = `Not OK` (color:red)
